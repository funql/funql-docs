# Licensing

FunQL software is available under two licensing options: the [GPLv2 license](./license-gplv2.md) and a Commercial
license. Each option is designed to fit different use cases, so read on to learn more about which license best suits
your project.

## License types

FunQL's open-source software implementations (such as [FunQL .NET](https://github.com/funql/funql-dotnet)) are available
under the [GPLv2 license](./license-gplv2.md). This license is ideal for open-source projects, private use, and
evaluation purposes.

Commercial projects can also use FunQL software under GPLv2, but if they distribute the software or make modifications,
they must release their full source code under the same GPLv2 license, including any derived work.

For commercial use with proprietary software, a **commercial license** is available. This license removes all GPLv2
restrictions, allowing you to embed FunQL software into closed-source products without needing to release your own
source code. Additionally, the commercial license provides access to software maintenance, including updates, upgrades,
and priority technical support.

## License fee structure

A commercial license for FunQL software consists of two components:

**A. One-time license fee**

The one-time license fee grants full access to the latest version of FunQL software at the time of purchase. This
license is bound to:

- A specific version of FunQL software
- A specific company

**B. Software maintenance and support subscription**

Software maintenance and support is **not included in the one-time license fee** and is available separately as an
annual subscription. This subscription provides:

- **Software updates and upgrades** — Stay up to date with critical releases, feature improvements, and security
  patches.
- **Priority support** — Get direct assistance from our engineering team.

The subscription is optional and can be renewed annually at your discretion.

## Licensing compliance

Using FunQL software in a commercial product without releasing your source code under GPLv2 or purchasing a commercial
license can have legal ramifications. By integrating FunQL software, you agree to comply with GPLv2 terms.

We cannot determine whether your application complies with GPLv2. It is your responsibility to review and understand the
licensing terms. To ensure compliance, we strongly recommend consulting legal counsel or licensing specialists rather
than relying on informal advice.

Any application using FunQL software — or other OSS-licensed code — without verifying its licensing compliance does so
at its own risk. If you are unsure which license is right for you, [contact us](mailto:support@funql.io) to discuss
licensing options.

## Frequently asked questions

### When do I need a commercial license?

If your product is commercial, you have two options:

1. **Use FunQL software under the GPLv2 license** — This requires you to fully open-source your project. 
2. **Purchase a commercial license** — This allows you to use FunQL software in a closed-source project without GPLv2
  obligations.

If you are unsure which option is best for you, [contact us](mailto:support@funql.io) to discuss your specific needs.
